## Finding Events

MLH publishes the list of the Hackathons they are working with
[here](https://mlh.io/eu).

Events are normally advertised on
[Hackathon Hackers EU](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackerseu/).

Some events might be listed or use on [Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.co.uk), or registered with [Ti.to](http://ti.to) services or MyMLH, but not every event uses it for tickets.

**This website has a (fairly) comprehensive list of UK hackathons on the [homepage](/).**
