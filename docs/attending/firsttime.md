## FAQ

### What actually is a Hackathon?

A Hackathon is an event where you work on a project for a set period of time
and then share what you did with the other attendees. Often with prizes for
projects that impress the judges.

We like to call them invention marathons.

### Do I need to be able to program?

They are great for learning how to! With workshops and being the sort of
environment filled with people working on projects you should be able to pick
up some knowledge to build something cool!

You don't need to do a pure software project! Electronics, design and all sorts
of things are normally allowed!

### Do I sleep?

It's highly recommended to sleep. You won't actually get any more work done.

Most hacks will provide a sleeping area.

### Do I need a team?

Most hackathons let you work alone or in teams of up to 4.

### What can I work on?

Most events let you work on what you want (except themed events).

They'll often have sponsor challenges if you want to work towards one of the
sponsor prize.

MLH provide a hardware lab for those of you who would like to do hardware hacks. Many hackathons also have their own hardware available to use.
