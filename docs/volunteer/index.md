As Hackathons are mostly organised as a non-profit venture by students, they
always appreciate extra help!

Helping out a hackathon is a great way to get started with organising!

## Events looking for help

You can add to this list by submitting a PR [here](https://github.com/HHEU/wiki)

## Mentoring

Amazing hacks wouldn't happen without amazing support! Hackathons are always looking for mentors to help their hackers with their projects throughout the event.

Some events have a mentoring system, where hackers can submit their problems, whilst others use Slack or Discord channels as a space for people to communicate.
