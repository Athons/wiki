As Hackathons are mostly organised as a non-profit venture by students, they
always appreciate extra help!

Helping out a hackathon is a great way to get started with organising!

## Events looking for help

You can add to this list by submitting a PR [here](https://github.com/HHEU/wiki)

## Mentoring

Amazing hacks wouldn't happen without amazing support! Hackathons are always looking for mentors to help their hackers with their projects throughout the event.

Some events have a mentoring system, where hackers can submit their problems, whilst others use Slack or Discord channels as a space for people to communicate.

If you're interested in helping hackers get the best experience, get in contact with the hackathon organisers and they will let you know more information about their mentoring system!
