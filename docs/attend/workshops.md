A lot of Hackathons tend to run workshops, which can be helpful if it's your first time programming or what to try something new.

Common Workshops:

* [Introduction to Git](workshops/introtogit.md)
* Basic Python Programming
* Making your first website

_Note: Some can also provide more technical-heavy workshops, but it is uncommon._

Hackathons, if capable and able to, will also allow associated sponsors to provide their own workshops to provide more understanding of how to use their products.

* Twillio / Nexmo with their API usage
* GitHub with their internal systems (Previously ElectronJS) 

You can also find, if doable, organisers or the university's hackathon/CS Society will provide providing their own workshops.

MLH Member Events will run a [BlackRock-branded Capture the Flag](https://localhost.mlh.io/#activities).
MLH events may also do something from this [list](https://localhost.mlh.io/#activities) if asked.

## Existing Workshops

You can find some of the other workshops run by members of the hacker community. Slides can typically be found in the GitHub repository README.
