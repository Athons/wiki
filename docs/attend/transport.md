Certain hackathons supply travel reimbursement for you to attend.

Sometimes travel is expensive, make sure you try:

* Car Sharing
* Trains
* Public transport
* Private bus companies

Sometimes hackathons will have information on how to attend their event. However if you're confused/unsure about something, don't hesitate to contact the hackathon organising team. They'll be happy to help!
