# Opening and Closing Ceremonies

Every hackathon has an opening and closing ceremony. Some also have presentations from the hackers. 

This normally works well inside a lecture theatre that has enough seating for your attendees, sponsors, volunteers, and organisers. You can also use an auditorium for this too.

## Opening Ceremony

A general structure:

* Welcome to the hackathon
* Event schedule
* Things going on at the hackathon
* Devpost
* Sponsors
* Challenges

## Presentations

Your hackathon may have presentations for all attendees, or just the finalist. Make sure you have some dongles to ensure they can connect up to the display.

Some of the things people might want for their presentation:

* Audio out of their laptop
* Video from 2 laptops
* Camera feed on a hardware hack

## Closing Ceremony

General structure:
* Prizes
* Thank yous to the sponsors
* Final thank you

## Add a professional touch to your AV

Will Russell from HackTheMidlands has a box of dongles and adapters to help you connect up any computer to your display. 
On top of that, he can also run your ceremonies and presentations, adding background music and smooth transitions.

Hackathons he has sorted the Audio and Visuals (AV) for:
* HackTheMidlands 4.0 as AV Lead
* OxfordHack 2019 by providing the dongle box
* DurHack 2019 by running the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as providing the dongle box.

For Spring Season 2020, he will have a production switcher to help make hackathons have even smoother presentations, allowing for easy transitions between laptops, background music and more options for audio during presentations.
