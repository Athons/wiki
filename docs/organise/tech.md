## Communication

Two main options here:

* Slack
* Discord

## Hosting

Netlify is great for static sites and what this wiki is hosted on.

For dynamic things, you could use heroku which has a good free tier. (and
not a bad option for bots)

Firebase also works pretty well if you don't want to maintain any
infrastructure.

## Info Hub

The Manchester CS society wrote a [hub](https://github.com/unicsmcr/hs_hub)
they use to track achievements and submissions at StudentHack and GreatUniHack.

## Signage

[LibreSignage](https://github.com/eerotal/LibreSignage) is a good open source
solution, but does need some patches to get it to do what you want. Works with
any web browser.

[info beamer](https://info-beamer.com/doc/info-beamer) is a powerful option
and free if you self host it. Used at large conferences like the CCC. Runs on
a Pi or whatever mini computer you have.

## Navigation

If you are running a very large event with a huge venue, it might be worth
forking [c3nav](https://github.com/c3nav/c3nav)
