# Photography

Post photos from your hackathon on your social media.

Make sure the photos don't contain anyone who didn't agree to photography consent. You can make this easy by getting those who don't want to be in photos to wear a different coloured lanyard.

Hackers love seeing photos of the hackathon, so be sure to share the album on all your social media accounts.

## Where to store your photos

* Google Photos is very easy to create albums, and share them with others
* Facebook allows you make albums on your Facebook page. This can help with publicity, and future sponsorship as it's very easy to share with friends etc.

Avoid using cloud storage to store the photos, as it makes it hard to look through them on a mobile device. If someone wants an original copy, they can get in contact.
