## Finding a venue

When looking for a venue, you want to pay attention to the following:

* Placement of electrical sockets
* Quality of network access
* Enough chairs and tables for hackers to use
* Overnight access (if it's a 24 hour hackathon)
* Cost

In most cases if you are a student hackathon you'll end up running in one of
the following:

* A Engineering Building
* A Business Schools Building
* A Student Union Building

Ideally, you shouldn't end up paying for a venue unless you are running
an extremely large event.

If you can not find a venue on campus and your university is in a major city
you might find a local tech company willing to host you.

## Booking

Getting a building for a whole weekend will take a lot of work. Your university
will be very hesitant if they have not previously hosted a hackathon before.

It is _NOT_ something you can sort out in two weeks. You will jump between
different people trying to find who handles it as you can not book though
your normal room booking system.

To give a time frame, for CovHack we were trying to get our venue booked for
about 4 months.

## Security

How security is handled really depends on your university. They'll have staff
on anyway, but they may need to arrange for more people. This might be
something you need to allocate extra funds for.

Remember to treat them well and offer them some of your food! Having security
on your side will make running future events easier.

## Things to Consider

You can't "officially" let people sleep in most venues due to insurance reasons
but your buildings security mostly will relax the rule. Just say your sleeping
room is a relaxation room :)
