# Food

Food is a crucial part for any hackathon. You should have catering in place for lunch both days, along with dinner and breakfast. It's also best to provide hackers with snacks during the event.

## Snacks

It's best not to place all your snacks out at once. This prevents you running out on the first day, and stops hackers making themselves full before you serve them meals.

It's best to store your snacks in an separate room for organisers/volunteers/mentors. Someone can be responsible for placing these out throughout the event.
