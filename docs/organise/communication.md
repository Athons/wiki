### [HackathonHackers EU](https://hackathonhackers.eu/)

First ran at Nottingham University in 2019, acted as the UKs official watch
party for [MLHs Hackcon digital](https://hackcon.mlh.io/events/hackcon-digital/).

Very worthwhile to attend if you are a new organiser!

Ran primarily in the US, though they previously ran it in London and Berlin.

Unclear if it will return to having events in Europe.
