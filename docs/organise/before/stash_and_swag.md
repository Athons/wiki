## T-shirts 

Another great item of swag that hackathon attendees love is t-shirts! While these aren't necessary for an event, they are a welcome addition.    

It is also easier if you have different coloured/designed t-shirts for different roles of the people at the event eg. Blue for Organisers, Green for Hackers, Yellow for Mentors etc.   
This allows easier to identify someone of importance at your event with ease, especially for larger events.  

### T-shirt providers

Currently, many hackathons across the UK use [Go2Dave](https://www.go2dave.co.uk/) as the products in their [short lead time catalogue](http://www.pp.prod-cat.com/index.php) can be ordered up to 10 business days ahead of the event. Other t-shirt providers are available.

### T-shirt sizes

Getting the correct number of the right size of a t-shirt is a skill of its own! We would recommend that as part of the sign-up/ticket buying process to best estimate the sizes you require.    

It is hard to predict but as a general rule of thumb, the 1-2-2-1 ratio (S: M : L : XL) is a good prediction if you don't have data to hand!
