## Budget

Budgets are what makes the hackathon work properly. They provide refreshments, meals, prizes, etc. from sponsors. Your budget will come from your [sponsors](/organise/sponsorship) and at times, depending on budget history, any surplus from the previous hackathon's budget.

Things to consider:

* Not everyone is present at every meal. (But sponsors and volunteers need food too.)
* Most hackathons have an attrition rate (tickets sold that will not attend) of 30-50%, usually around 40%.
* Try and have some money put aside for on-the-day emergencies.

### Examples

Feel free to publish your hackathon budget here! Either as a link or upload it to the repo, preferably in an open format!

but it over estimates a lot, including assuming a 500 person attendance.
