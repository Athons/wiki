# Judging

## Who should be your judges?
The following are all groups you can select judges from, though it is recommended to sample from each pool available to you. 

- Sponsors (They may also be judging to give away sponsor prizes)
- Mentors
- Organisers
- University Faculty

When selecting judges you should aim to have enough judges to cover all of your hacks in a reasonable timeframe. Bias should be avoided if possible.  

## How to structure judging?
Allocate adequate time given your number of judges and attendees to allow the judges adequate time to consider each hack they need to judge.

### Presentations
This is the simplist approach to judging, every team presents their hack to all attendees and judges with a small, 3-5 minute, slot. Judges will see all hacks but this can become incredibly time consuming for large hackathons.

### Science Fair
Here all the hacks set up in effect a stall to show off their hack, judges will visit a subset of all hacks and report back to select a top "**n**" that then present their hacks to the entire hackathon. Benefits from immense parallelisation but can create unruly and biased judging reports if the judges marking subset A are all marking higher than those marking subset B. [Gavel](https://github.com/anishathalye/gavel) can alliviate this by using comparative judging. In any case how to organise the judge's routes should be considered with simple assignments based off of Devpost being available [here](https://github.com/nealrs/expo).

## How should you score demos?

- Points system
- [Gavel](https://github.com/anishathalye/gavel) (Works best for Science Fairs)
- [Shawee](https://shawee.io/) (Known but untested)
- Shortlist top 5 

## Example Criteria

It's a good idea to decide your judging criteria before the event. CovHack has shared their judging criteria for CovHack2020 [here](/static/documents/judging/covhack2020-judging-criteria.pdf)!
