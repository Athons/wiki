## Code Golf

The [MancJS code golf server](https://github.com/mancjs/mancjs-code-golf) is pretty good, but requires uploading a
file instead of editing it in the browser.

You will need to write extra challenges as the built-in ones aren't very good.

CovHack has a dockerised fork [here](https://github.com/CovHackSoc/mancjs-code-golf)
for easy deployment.

## Werewolf

Werewolf, sometimes referred to as Mafia, is a party game like the game "Town of Salem". Roles and rules can be found [here](https://www.playwerewolf.co/rules/roles) but 
is effectively a race to find who the werewolf is before all the villagers get killed.

## Code in the Dark

Basically, recreate a website without out previewing your code.

Under MLH events this goes as `!light`.

[@baahorn](https://twitter.com/baahorn) forked MLHs service for CovHack and
removed MLH branding (a licence requirement) and the dependency on MyMLH.

Otherwise, you can use the [editor here](https://github.com/codeinthedark/codeinthedark.github.io)
and use a google drive folder for uploads.

## University Societies

HackNotts in particular has had success inviting university societies such as the Video and Board Game Societies to run mini events or games corner.
