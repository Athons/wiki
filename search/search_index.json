What do I need There are two main things you need: 1 - Git 2 - GitHub Account (This can be substituted for others such as GitLab or BitBucket ) If you're on windows you can either use the github GUI application or git command line version. As the command line version is global across Windows, Linux and Mac we will describe that here. Lots of Integrated development environments (IDE's) like Atom and VS Code have their own inbuilt GUI systems for Git integration. These are again out of scope here for now. Creating a Repository Repository Name After logging into GitHub you can create a new repository by clicking the + symbol at the top right. You should be presented with a form like screen asking for a repository name, if you already have your hack idea name you can enter it here or if not you could use the hackathon name (aka \"HackSheffield 5\"). These names don't need to be globally unique but must be different to any repository you've made before. Description Enter in a short description of your hack here if you have one, this will be shown at the header of your repository and can be changed at any time so don't worry about not putting one in yet. Public/Private You now have infinite Public and Private repositories, a public repository can be seen by anyone whilst a private repository is just for you. Public repositories still require collaborators or pull requests to be changed by other people. Initialise We will be creating the repository from scratch so no need for any of these settings to be changed. A file named \"README.md\" will be displayed at the front page of your repository and therefore can be used as a manual or title page. A .gitignore file can be used to select certain files in your repository to never commit such as files with passwords in. Licenses can be used to explain to a user what the can and can't do with your code. Click Create Now click create and you have made a repository! Linking your project to GitHub With a repository now on github we can link this to a local folder. Create a local project folder First make a folder either using folder explorer or finder etc... or using the terminal/cmd/console you can use the command cd to change directory (aka cd Desktop ) and then using mkdir (aka mkdir HS5 ) to create the folder. You'll need to then cd into that folder again (aka cd HS5 ). Initialise local folder We now need to tell git that this is where our repository lives. We intitalise this by using the command git init after cd ing to our folder. First commit Add To begin we will make a README.md file in our new git repository, you can do this using notepad or in console using vim/emacs/nano, the fastest method is to echo directly into the file using echo \"# testRepository\" >> README.md . We can then tell git we want to add these changes using git add README.md or if you'd like to add all files in the folder git add . . Commit These additions then need to be boxed into a commit using git commit -m \"First commit\" , here the -m stands for message and \"First commit\"is what these changes will be labeled as in GitHub. Remote Currently our folder doesn't know which repository to send this to and so we have to link the folder to our repository, int GitHub you should find the repository remote at the top labelled \"Quick setup\". Take the link shown there (Best to start with HTTPS) and type git remote add origin followed by the link (aka git remote add origin https://github.com/Hammie217/firstRepository.git ). You should only ever need to run this command at setup of a repository. Push Now git know what we want to commit and where to all we have to do is push or commits to GitHub, we do this using git push origin master . Telling git we want to push our origin to the master branch. Voila You should now be able to see your code in GitHub after you refresh the page! Add collaborators Collaborators can be added in: Settings -> Collaborators. Where you should be able to search for their GitHub accounts. Later commits To add more things to the repository there are three things you need to follow: git add . git commit -m \"Message\" git push origin master Medium Git Merge conflicts Merge conflicts happen when two people try to change the same file lines resulting in conflicting code. To fix these one contributor needs to act to mediate these conflicts to choose which code should stay and what is un-needed. Many IDEs (definitely Atom and VS Code ) have inbuilt systems to help deal with merge conflicts. Status The best thing to do first is to find out where the issues are, the best method of doing this is git status . Most of the time you will see Both modified next to a file name, sometimes a file may have been deleted in another branch. Resolving The easiest method is to use an IDE, start by finding the offending file(s), in Atom and VS Code the sections of code will be highlighted with buttons to select local or remote or both changes to be kept. Use your best intuition to change the code to what is best. Uh Oh In the case you've messed up the merge conflicts and things don't work you can abort the merge at any point to return to the pre-merged state using git merge --abort Pushing After the code is working as desired a normal commit cycle of add, commit and push will send the merged file to GitHub. Branching Creating a branch git checkout -b \"BranchName\" Push git push origin BranchName Merge git checkout master git merge BranchName Pull requests Fork Fork the repository you want to Pull Request using GitHub Fork button at the top right of the repository. Clone the repository to your PC using git clone RepositoryLink where the Repository link is the link found in your forked repository clone button. Branch Create a branch using git checkout -b \"BranchName\" Push changes git add . git commit -m \"Message\" git push origin BranchName Pull Request On the repository you would like to accept your PR you should see a green banner with a button exclaiming change. Follow the pull request section until you enter your code for a review. Your code may be accepted or asked for changes depending on if your code meets the requirements. Simply make the changes and commit again, you may however be required to request a review from your previous reviewer.

A Hackathon is an event where you work on a project for a set period of time and then share what you did with the other attendees. Often with prizes for projects that impress the judges. We like to call them invention marathons. Do I need to be able to program? They are great for learning how to! With workshops and being the sort of environment filled with people working on projects you should be able to pick up some knowledge to build something cool! You don't need to do a pure software project! Electronics, design and all sorts of things are normally allowed! Do I sleep? It's highly recommended to sleep. You won't actually get any more work done. Most hacks will provide a sleeping area. Do I need a team? Most hackathons let you work alone or in teams of up to 4. What can I work on?

If there is a challenge that interest you or a themed challenge, do go in and give it a try. \ud83d\ude0a Some hackathons do have challenges dedicated for first-time hackers or newcomers as well. Otherwise, there are tools like Processing and it's Javascript counterpart p5.js which are great for making visual projects. Python has many good libraries available if you are trying to process some data from a website. Data sources will tend to provide JSON data which Python can handle very well! Otherwise Javascript with Node is also very suitable for this task. Mashing up two APIs creatively is one of the best projects you can do. For example, displaying crime data from data.police.uk over a map. Getting started with hardware you may want to look at using arduino and use sensors alongside this to read inputs such as movement from an accelerometer or light levels with an LDR. Arduinos can also drive outputs such as LEDs or relays. MLH provides starter packs for both Python and NodeJS . Intermediate Machine Learning projects are common for a good reason! Building your own from scratch using tools like scikit-learn or TensorFlow is a lot of fun, but there's also a ton of pre-built models that are worth a look, as well as Google Cloud Platform's Cloud AI that has all sorts of fantastic tools. Mobile development is popular, with many good tool options available. You can either use the Standard Android Studio or XCode if you plan on using Java/Kotlin/Swift or try something like React-Native if you prefer JavaScript, or Flutter if you want to try something new! Making a game is always a good project, especially if you are in a team as it makes it simple to split up the work and even better if you have a non-technical team member as they can help make assets.

You can also use an auditorium for this too. Opening Ceremony A general structure: Welcome to the hackathon. Event schedule. Things going on at the hackathon. Safety information (fire alarm, etc). Mentors. Devpost. Sponsors. Challenges. Presentations Your hackathon may have presentations for all attendees, or just the finalist. Make sure you have some dongles to ensure they can connect up to the display. USB C and Mini Display port are very common (MacBooks and Surface Pros), but it doesn't hurt to have others too! Most lecture theatres have HDMI and VGA already in them, which will cover most situations. Some also have a visualiser that is useful for hardware hacks.

You might need to keep people to only having one portion if you are dealing with certain businesses. This can be done with either a tick mark on their wristbands (Like HackSheffield) or a card (like StudentHack) or even a QR code (like HackUPC). For snacks, having a table and periodically adding new things to it as it gets emptied works. It's worth trying to time this after meals to avoid people getting full before a whole meal. Snack tables should ideally be out of direct sight of the hackers, especially at larger hackathons, to avoid the crab bucket. What to get It tends to be preferable to get food the hackers can eat with their hands over things like curries. It's generally recommended to have some food at midnight as the time between dinner and Breakfast is quite long. But budget-wise, this can be quite hard to do if you are tight on money. Just some experiences and comments on various places. (We do appreciate comments on smaller businesses as well as other events nearby benefit!) Main Meals Food Trucks You might find nearby food trucks capable of serving your event. Food can be higher quality than the normal franchise and give attendees more of a choice, but does tend to be a bit more expensive. The queues can be quite long, and if they setup outside in the colder months it might be bit too cold for attendees to stand outside for too long. Advised against for larger hackathons. Dominos Everyone love pizza. Can be quite expensive. Cost quoted to CovHack was \u00a38 per large pizza. Need to get a good balance. Over buying Margarita tends to be an issue. The Vegan pizza is not well liked. Papa John's The Vegan pizza is generally much better received compared to Dominos. Subway Platters Generally goes down well. They tend to need a lot of time to prepare, so lunch might need run later. Really good option for vegetarians! And they provide sheets regarding allergies etc. It's about \u00a318-\u00a320 per plater, with some volume discounts. McDonalds Very good for large orders and very well priced. Tends to go down well with hackers. Decent for vegetarians, if a little boring. They can take the order pretty close to the event (handy if you get funding late) CovHack had a really good experience with our local franchise and AstonHack has had it most years. Zizzis Offers a good vegan pizza and has a whole menu for dietary requirements Breakfast Heading to an Aldi/Lidl/Costco/Makro and picking up various things is what tends to work best. Breakfast never tends to be too well attended. Many companies that provide breakfast simply do the Costco shop for you and charge you double. Snacks Usual costco stuff works well. Various soft drinks, crisps, etc. Try not to buy purely caffenated drinks, if hackers would like to deteriorate their health let them do it, not you. Dietary Requirements Make sure you cater for people with dietary requirements first! This reduces issues related to cross-contamination. It's potentially worth sending an email about what you are serving beforehand to find out issues beforehand. You should keep note of who has requirements that can't be covered by your normal food sources and also maintain a list of places that can cover all the common requirements so attendees do not have to wait for several hours. Some common requirements to have are: Vegetarians Pescatarians Vegans Gluten Free Lactose Intolerance / Dairy Free Religious Requirements Allergies Some sites that had relatively good information on these: https://ebpcooh.org.uk/common-dietary-requirements-explained/ https://www.comtix.com/blog/7-dietary-restrictions-every-event-planner-aware/ Vegetarians Vegetarians are fairly easy to handle. Most places will offer vegetarian options at the same cost of normal options. Worth considering is that some vegetarians don't consume eggs (some religious requirements cover this) Pescatarians As you generally do not serve fish at hackathons, Pescatarians can be handled the same way as Vegetarians. Vegans Vegans do not consume animal products, which means even a lot of vegetarian options aren't suitable. You can either structure your vegetarian food to be vegan, or get arrange it separr Gluten Free Some people suffer from various conditions that mean they can not consume gluten, which covers protein found in wheat, barley, rye and oats. A lot of places will offer food that is gluten free nowadays, but you have to check with everyone. Lactose Intolerance / Dairy Free Lactose Intolerance is not the same thing as a dairy free. Those with dairy allergies can be very serious, so it's best to check with the hacker about how serious it is. Not being able to consume dairy effects a lot of options. Most chains will cover it though. Remember, eggs aren't dairy so they can be part of options for this. Religious Requirements Events normally cover religious requirements like Halal/Kosher with vegetarian options, but if you can offer it it would probably be appreciated. Allergies Allergies can be quite hard to handle due to how variable they can be. You'll have to ask attendees when they register and when they arrive so you can accommodate this. One key thing to handle is cross contamination. Allow those with allergies to be served first, so the allergen options don't get cross containmened from other options. This also ensures there are still availabile options before the rest of the hackers eat. You can find some information on the NHS website covering common ones Try to keep an emergancy contact for each of your contacts if you have someone with a strange allergy.","title":"Catering"},{"location":"organise/catering/#catering","text":"","title":"Catering"},{"location":"organise/catering/#distribution","text":"For main meals, you'll need to sort of people with dietary requirements first.

For snacks, having a table and periodically adding new things to it as it gets emptied works. It's worth trying to time this after meals to avoid people getting full before a whole meal.

Prospectus You need to write a sponsorship prospectus. You can find tons of examples in the MLHs repository The DurHack19 Sponsorship Deck can be found here Finding Sponsors Unfortunately the best way to get sponsorship is to 'cold email' as many companies as possible. Remember to try and tailor the initial email to the company and to think about what that company will want to get out of the hackathon, a local startup will want something very different to Microsoft. A few could starting places when looking for sponsors: * Your university/department, most hackathons manage to get their Computer Science department (or equivalent) to put in some money, especially to help with a new hackathon. * Local county/city council. * Spinoff companies from your university/department. * Your department's advisory board, this is normally full of companies who want to help students! A good tool to keep track of all the potential sponsors is a CRM, e.g. hubspot, you can add contacts to it as well as set up a sponsorship pipeline. Contracts An example contract with terms removed can be seen here . Many Student Unions have a legal department dedicated to writing, amending, approving and enforcing contracts. It's always nice to have the SU have your back in the unlikely case of a rougue sponsor. The Manchester Computer Science society has a public script for doing contract generation based on templates, which might be helpful if you are doing a lot. Sponsorship Tiers This is a core element of the hackathon budget as well as how the hackathon runs. Having different tiers can provide different addons of what a sponsor can do within the hackathon. Most hackathons have at least 3 different tiers which is a common trend between different hackathons. Some sponsors may find it easier for them to provide in kind sponsorship, this might be in the form of prizes, a venue or energy drinks. In kind sponsorship is very useful still, as it will help cut your costs but remember that you do also need enough sponsors who can provide cash. Note: This is a sample tier system with addons. Top Tier This is the best tier which will provide the most amount of abilities in the hackathon. General hackathon abilites may include: 2+ Workshops Abilitiy to come to the hackathon Social Media Presence Judging Panel Tier Price can be at least 1/3 to 40% of the hackathon budget Tips: For first time hackathons, best to have up to 2 if possible. Mid Tier This is the most common tier which will provide the stable amount of abilities within the hackathon. General hackathon abilites may include: Abilitiy to come to the hackathon 1 Workshop Social Media Presence Judging Panel Tier Price can be at least 25% of the hackathon budget Tips: For first time hackathons, best to have up to 1 if possible.

You may however be asked to pay for cleaning and portering of your event as below. If you can not find a venue on campus and your university is in a major city you might find a local tech company willing to host you. Booking Getting a building for a whole weekend will take a lot of work. Your university will be very hesitant if they have not previously hosted a hackathon before. It is NOT something you can sort out in two weeks. You will jump between different people trying to find who handles it as you can not book though your normal room booking system. To give a time frame, for CovHack we were trying to get our venue booked for about 4 months. Security How security is handled really depends on your university. They'll have staff on anyway, but they may need to arrange for more people. This might be something you need to allocate extra funds for. Remember to treat them well and offer them some of your food! Having security on your side will make running future events easier. Security tend to be first aid and heavy lifting trained but is worth checking. This can be a big benefit for risk assessments and red tape. Things to Consider You can't \"officially\" let people sleep in most venues due to insurance reasons but your buildings security mostly will relax the rule.
