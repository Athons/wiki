Get food at various times Finish hacking at midday Present Projects Present awards and closing ceremony FAQ What actually is a Hackathon? A Hackathon is an event where you work on a project for a set period of time and then share what you did with the other attendees. Often with prizes for projects that impress the judges. We like to call them invention marathons. Do I need to be able to program? They are great for learning how to! With workshops and being the sort of environment filled with people working on projects you should be able to pick up some knowledge to build something cool! You don't need to do a pure software project! Electronics, design and all sorts of things are normally allowed! Do I sleep? It's highly recommended to sleep. You won't actually get any more work done. Most hacks will provide a sleeping area. Do I need a team? Most hackathons let you work alone or in teams of up to 4. What can I work on? Most events let you work on what you want (except themed events). They'll often have sponsor challenges if you want to work towards one of the sponsor prize.

No point trying to do something either really below your skill level or something way beyond it. You'll get the best experience with a Hackathon if you try and learn something new! Beginner If you are just learning programming for the first time, making a simple website is a great thing to try. Otherwise, there are tools like Processing and it's Javascript counterpart p5.js which are great for making visual projects. Python has many good libraries available if you are trying to process some data from a website. Data sources will tend to provide JSON data which Python can handle very well! Otherwise Javascript with Node is also very suitable for this task. Mashing up two APIs creatively is one of the best projects you can do. For example, displaying crime data from data.police.uk over a map. Getting started with hardware you may want to look at using arduino and use sensors alongside this to read inputs such as movement from an accelerometer or light levels with an LDR. Arduinos can also drive outputs such as LEDs or relays. Intermediate Machine Learning projects are common for a good reason! Building your own from scratch using tools like scikit-learn or TensorFlow is a lot of fun, but there's also a ton of pre-built models that are worth a look, as well as Google Cloud Platform's Cloud AI that has all sorts of fantastic tools. Mobile development is popular, with many good tool options available. You can either use the Standard Android Studio or XCode if you plan on using Java/Kotlin/Swift or try something like React-Native if you prefer JavaScript, or Flutter if you want to try something new! Making a game is always a good project, especially if you are in a team as it makes it simple to split up the work and even better if you have a non-technical team member as they can help make assets. Common environments used include: Godot - A free and open source game engine. Unity - Free for non commerical use and very popular with indie developers and industry. Unreal Engine - Very big in industry and free for small studios. Game Maker - Common with Indie developers but does cost money. Raspberry pi's are very useful for more complex hardware projects, raspberry pi's have much more processing power than arduinos/microprocessors. Try using a camera with opencv or some TensorFlow CNNs. For inputs and output control try using the wiringPi library. Advanced You probably already have some idea of what you are interested in doing, but looking at things you aren't familiar with is probably the best use of a Hackathon for you!","title":"What to make"},{"location":"attending/projects/#topicstools-to-look-at","text":"The best things to look at depend on your skill level.

You might need to keep people to only having one portion if you are dealing with certain businesses. This can be done with either a tick mark on their wristbands (Like HackSheffield) or a card (like StudentHack) or even a QR code (like HackUPC). For snacks, having a table and periodically adding new things to it as it gets emptied works. It's worth trying to time this after meals to avoid people getting full before a whole meal. Snack tables should ideally be out of direct sight of the hackers, especially at larger hackathons, to avoid the crab bucket. What to get It tends to be preferable to get food the hackers can eat with their hands over things like curries. It's generally recommended to have some food at midnight as the time between dinner and Breakfast is quite long. But budget-wise, this can be quite hard to do if you are tight on money. Just some experiences and comments on various places. (We do appreciate comments on smaller businesses as well as other events nearby benefit!) Main Meals Food Trucks You might find nearby food trucks capable of serving your event. Food can be higher quality than the normal franchise and give attendees more of a choice, but does tend to be a bit more expensive. The queues can be quite long, and if they setup outside in the colder months it might be bit too cold for attendees to stand outside for too long. Advised against for larger hackathons. Dominos Everyone love pizza. Can be quite expensive. Cost quoted to CovHack was \u00a38 per large pizza. Need to get a good balance. Over buying Margarita tends to be an issue. The Vegan pizza is not well liked. Papa John's The Vegan pizza is generally much better received compared to Dominos. Subway Platters Generally goes down well. They tend to need a lot of time to prepare, so lunch might need run later. Really good option for vegetarians! And they provide sheets regarding allergies etc. It's about \u00a318-\u00a320 per plater, with some volume discounts. McDonalds Very good for large orders and very well priced. Tends to go down well with hackers. Decent for vegetarians, if a little boring. They can take the order pretty close to the event (handy if you get funding late) CovHack had a really good experience with our local franchise and AstonHack has had it most years. Zizzis Offers a good vegan pizza and has a whole menu for dietary requirements Breakfast Heading to an Aldi/Lidl/Costco/Makro and picking up various things is what tends to work best. Breakfast never tends to be too well attended. Many companies that provide breakfast simply do the Costco shop for you and charge you double. Snacks Usual costco stuff works well. Various soft drinks, crisps, etc. Try not to buy purely caffenated drinks, if hackers would like to deteriorate their health let them do it, not you. Dietary Requirements Make sure you cater for people with dietary requirements first! This reduces issues related to cross-contamination. It's potentially worth sending an email about what you are serving beforehand to find out issues beforehand. You should keep note of who has requirements that can't be covered by your normal food sources and also maintain a list of places that can cover all the common requirements so attendees do not have to wait for several hours. Some common requirements to have are: Vegetarians Pescatarians Vegans Gluten Free Lactose Intolerance / Dairy Free Religious Requirements Allergies Some sites that had relatively good information on these: https://ebpcooh.org.uk/common-dietary-requirements-explained/ https://www.comtix.com/blog/7-dietary-restrictions-every-event-planner-aware/ Vegetarians Vegetarians are fairly easy to handle. Most places will offer vegetarian options at the same cost of normal options. Worth considering is that some vegetarians don't consume eggs (some religious requirements cover this) Pescatarians As you generally do not serve fish at hackathons, Pescatarians can be handled the same way as Vegetarians. Vegans Vegans do not consume animal products, which means even a lot of vegetarian options aren't suitable. You can either structure your vegetarian food to be vegan, or get arrange it separr Gluten Free Some people suffer from various conditions that mean they can not consume gluten, which covers protein found in wheat, barley, rye and oats. A lot of places will offer food that is gluten free nowadays, but you have to check with everyone. Lactose Intolerance / Dairy Free Lactose Intolerance is not the same thing as a dairy free. Those with dairy allergies can be very serious, so it's best to check with the hacker about how serious it is. Not being able to consume dairy effects a lot of options. Most chains will cover it though. Remember, eggs aren't dairy so they can be part of options for this. Religious Requirements Events normally cover religious requirements like Halal/Kosher with vegetarian options, but if you can offer it it would probably be appreciated. Allergies Allergies can be quite hard to handle due to how variable they can be. You'll have to ask attendees when they register and when they arrive so you can accommodate this. One key thing to handle is cross contamination. Allow those with allergies to be served first, so the allergen options don't get cross containmened from other options. This also ensures there are still availabile options before the rest of the hackers eat. You can find some information on the NHS website covering common ones Try to keep an emergancy contact for each of your contacts if you have someone with a strange allergy.","title":"Catering"},{"location":"organise/catering/#catering","text":"","title":"Catering"},{"location":"organise/catering/#distribution","text":"For main meals, you'll need to sort of people with dietary requirements first.
