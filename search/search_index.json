What do I need? \u00b6 There are two main things you need: 1 - Git 2 - GitHub Account (This can be substituted for others such as GitLab or BitBucket ) If you're on windows you can either use the Github GUI application or Git command line version. As the command line version is global across Windows, Linux and Mac we will describe that here. Note for Mac Users: Git comes pre-installed, however it maybe installed with a previous version, instead of the current version Lots of Integrated development environments (IDE's) like Atom and VS Code have their own inbuilt GUI systems for Git integration. These are again out of scope here for now. Creating a Repository \u00b6 Repository Name \u00b6 After logging into GitHub you can create a new repository by clicking the + symbol at the top right. You should be presented with a form like screen asking for a repository name, if you already have your hack idea name you can enter it here or if not you could use the hackathon name (aka \"HackSheffield 5\"). These names don't need to be globally unique but must be different to any repository you've made before. Description \u00b6 Enter in a short description of your hack here if you have one, this will be shown at the header of your repository and can be changed at any time so don't worry about not putting one in yet. Public/Private \u00b6 You now have infinite Public and Private repositories, a public repository can be seen by anyone whilst a private repository is just for you. Public repositories still require collaborators or pull requests to be changed by other people. Initialise \u00b6 We will be creating the repository from scratch so no need for any of these settings to be changed. A file named \"README.md\" will be displayed at the front page of your repository and therefore can be used as a manual or title page. A .gitignore file can be used to select certain files in your repository to never commit such as files with passwords in. Licenses can be used to explain to a user what the can and can't do with your code. Click Create \u00b6 Now click create and you have made a repository! Linking your project to GitHub \u00b6 With a repository now on github we can link this to a local folder. Create a local project folder \u00b6 First make a folder either using folder explorer or finder etc... or using the terminal/cmd/console you can use the command cd to change directory (aka cd Desktop ) and then using mkdir (aka mkdir HS5 ) to create the folder. You'll need to then cd into that folder again (aka cd HS5 ). Initialise local folder \u00b6 We now need to tell git that this is where our repository lives. We intitalise this by using the command git init after cd ing to our folder. First commit \u00b6 Add \u00b6 To begin we will make a README.md file in our new git repository, you can do this using notepad or in console using vim/emacs/nano, the fastest method is to echo directly into the file using echo \"# testRepository\" >> README.md . We can then tell git we want to add these changes using git add README.md or if you'd like to add all files in the folder git add . . Commit \u00b6 These additions then need to be boxed into a commit using git commit -m \"First commit\" , here the -m stands for message and \"First commit\"is what these changes will be labeled as in GitHub. Remote \u00b6 Currently our folder doesn't know which repository to send this to and so we have to link the folder to our repository, int GitHub you should find the repository remote at the top labelled \"Quick setup\". Take the link shown there (Best to start with HTTPS) and type git remote add origin followed by the link (aka git remote add origin https://github.com/Hammie217/firstRepository.git ). You should only ever need to run this command at setup of a repository. Push \u00b6 Now git know what we want to commit and where to all we have to do is push or commits to GitHub, we do this using git push origin master . Telling git we want to push our origin to the master branch. Voila \u00b6 You should now be able to see your code in GitHub after you refresh the page! Add collaborators \u00b6 Collaborators can be added in: Settings -> Collaborators. Where you should be able to search for their GitHub accounts. Later commits \u00b6 To add more things to the repository there are three things you need to follow: git add . git commit -m \"Message\" git push origin master Medium Git \u00b6 Merge conflicts \u00b6 Merge conflicts happen when two people try to change the same file lines resulting in conflicting code. To fix these one contributor needs to act to mediate these conflicts to choose which code should stay and what is un-needed. Many IDEs (definitely Atom and VS Code ) have inbuilt systems to help deal with merge conflicts. Status \u00b6 The best thing to do first is to find out where the issues are, the best method of doing this is git status . Most of the time you will see Both modified next to a file name, sometimes a file may have been deleted in another branch. Resolving \u00b6 The easiest method is to use an IDE, start by finding the offending file(s), in Atom and VS Code the sections of code will be highlighted with buttons to select local or remote or both changes to be kept. Use your best intuition to change the code to what is best. Uh Oh \u00b6 In the case you've messed up the merge conflicts and things don't work you can abort the merge at any point to return to the pre-merged state using git merge --abort Pushing \u00b6 After the code is working as desired a normal commit cycle of add, commit and push will send the merged file to GitHub. Branching \u00b6 Creating a branch \u00b6 git checkout -b \"BranchName\" Push \u00b6 git push origin BranchName Merge \u00b6 git checkout master git merge BranchName Pull requests \u00b6 Fork \u00b6 Fork the repository you want to Pull Request using GitHub Fork button at the top right of the repository. Clone the repository to your PC using git clone RepositoryLink where the Repository link is the link found in your forked repository clone button. Branch \u00b6 Create a branch using git checkout -b \"BranchName\" Push changes \u00b6 git add . git commit -m \"Message\" git push origin BranchName Pull Request \u00b6 On the repository you would like to accept your PR you should see a green banner with a button exclaiming change. Follow the pull request section until you enter your code for a review. Your code may be accepted or asked for changes depending on if your code meets the requirements. Simply make the changes and commit again, you may however be required to request a review from your previous reviewer.

Look at how you achieved what you did, and what mistakes were made. It's important to do a debrief just after the hackathon while it's all fresh in your mind. For the positives, write down how you achieved them so you can repeat this for your successor hackathon. For the negatives, work out why they happened and if you can minimise the potential of it happening again. Mistakes are inevitable so don't beat yourself up about it. Documenting what happened will help everyone in the team understand how they can make the hackathon even better in the following year, especially if a new committee takes over. Last thing you want to do is waste time recreating the infrastructure that was created in a previous year, when you could be focusing on new and exciting things for your hackathon.","title":"Debrief"},{"location":"organise/after/photography/","text":"Photography \u00b6 Post photos from your hackathon on your social media.

This is a great way to introduce your event to your attendees, and give them all the information they'll need. This is also an opportunity for sponsors to talk too.

Opening Ceremony \u00b6 A general structure: Welcome to the hackathon Event schedule Things going on at the hackathon Safety information (fire alarm, etc) Mentors Devpost Sponsors Challenges Presentations \u00b6 Your hackathon may have presentations for all attendees, or just the finalist. Make sure you have some dongles to ensure they can connect up to the display. USB C and Mini Display port are very common (MacBooks and Surface Pros), but it doesn't hurt to have others too! Most lecture theatres have HDMI and VGA already in them, which will cover most situations. Some also have a visualiser that is useful for hardware hacks.

On top of that, he can also help with your ceremonies and presentations, adding background music and smooth transitions. Hackathons he has worked with: HackTheMidlands 4.0 as A/V Lead OxfordHack 2019 by providing the dongle box and running the presentations DurHack 2019 by running the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as providing the dongle box ManMetHacks 2.0 as Official A/V Partner Contact Will by email or on Twitter to see how he can help. Testimonials \u00b6 DurHack 2019 \u00b6 Will ran the A/V for our opening talks and helped bring a couple of great ideas about how to add polish and flair to bring energy to the room. He was able to adapt to our needs on-the-fly and keep transitions smooth between speakers. Will also did a fantastic job of running our finalist presentations entirely by himself. Having heard about his legendary(!) A/V skills at OxfordHack 2019, I had full faith that Will would pull through and keep our presentations seamless and on schedule \u2013 and he stepped up to the challenge and ran the presentations with no drama. I was able to step back and focus on other things while Will got teams quickly and effectively onboarded with the relevant A/V set up, and was able to professionally handle issues and special requirements. I would love to have Will at every event I'm at! \u2014 Robbie Jakob-Whitworth , Lead Organiser, DurHack 2017\u20132019 ManMetHacks 2.0 \u00b6 Will's constant devotion to our event and the AV solutions involved were far more than anyone could have expected for a volunteer. He created animated assets that adhered to the branding guidelines and looked stunning and really added to the experience of opening ceremony. He also helped form the basis of our opening and closing ceremony slides and made doing finalist presentations a breeze due to picture-in-picture really helping for hardware hacks. I first met Will at HackTheMidlands 4.0 and after seeing what an impressive job he and the rest of Levitation Events did with the sound, lighting and visuals, I almost begged him to be a part of ManMetHacks.

You might need to keep people to only having one portion if you are dealing with certain businesses. This can be done with either a tick mark on their wristbands (like HackSheffield) or a card (like StudentHack) or even a QR code (like HackUPC). For snacks, having a table and periodically adding new things to it as it gets emptied works. It's worth trying to time this after meals to avoid people getting full before a whole meal. Snack tables should ideally be out of direct sight of the hackers, especially at larger hackathons, to avoid the crab bucket. What To Get \u00b6 It tends to be preferable to get food the hackers can eat with their hands over things like curries. It's generally recommended to have some food at midnight as the time between dinner and Breakfast is quite long. But budget-wise, this can be quite hard to do if you are tight on money. Just some experiences and comments on various places. (We do appreciate comments on smaller businesses as well as other events nearby benefit!) Main Meals \u00b6 Food Trucks \u00b6 You might find nearby food trucks capable of serving your event. Food can be higher quality than the normal franchise and give attendees more of a choice, but does tend to be a bit more expensive. The queues can be quite long, and if they setup outside in the colder months it might be bit too cold for attendees to stand outside for too long. Advised against for larger-sized hackathons. Dominos \u00b6 Everyone love pizza. Can be quite expensive, but depends on the hackathon location and nearest pizza delivery store. Cost quoted to CovHack was \u00a38 per large pizza, where HackNotts pay \u00a36 per large. Need to get a good balance. Over buying Margarita tends to be an issue. The vegan pizza is not well liked. Papa John's \u00b6 The vegan pizza, generally, is much better received compared to Dominos. Subway Platters \u00b6 Generally goes down well. They tend to need a lot of time to prepare, so lunch might need run later. Generally done as a Lunch either on the start or the end of the hackaathon. Really good option for vegetarians! And they provide sheets regarding allergies, etc. It's about \u00a318-\u00a320 per plater, with some volume discounts. McDonalds \u00b6 Very good for large orders and very well priced. Tends to go down well with hackers. Decent for vegetarians, if a little boring. They can take the order pretty close to the event. (Handy if you get funding late.) CovHack had a really good experience with our local franchise and AstonHack has had it starting AstonHack 4. Zizzis \u00b6 Offers a good vegan pizza and has a whole menu for dietary requirements . Breakfast \u00b6 Heading to an Aldi/Lidl/Costco/Makro and picking up various things is what tends to work best. Breakfast never tends to be too well attended. Many companies that provide breakfast simply do the Costco shop for you and charge you double. Snacks \u00b6 Usual Costco stuff works well. Various soft drinks, juices, crisps, sweets, etc. Try not to buy purely caffenated drinks, if hackers would like to deteriorate their health let them do it, not you. Dietary Requirements \u00b6 Make sure you cater for people with dietary requirements first! This reduces issues related to cross-contamination. It's potentially worth sending an email about what you are serving beforehand to find out issues beforehand. You should keep note of who has requirements that can't be covered by your normal food sources and also maintain a list of places that can cover all the common requirements so attendees do not have to wait for several hours. Hackathons usually do this via their ticket booking system as it is recorded to the attendee. Some common requirements to have are: Vegetarians Pescatarians Vegans Gluten Free Lactose Intolerance / Dairy Free Religious Requirements (eg: Halal) Allergies (eg: Nuts) Some sites that had relatively good information on these: EBPCOOH comtix Vegetarians \u00b6 Vegetarians are fairly easy to handle. Most places will offer vegetarian options at the same cost of normal options. Worth considering is that some vegetarians don't consume eggs (some religious requirements cover this.) Pescatarians \u00b6 As you generally do not serve fish at hackathons, pescatarians can be handled the same way as vegetarians. Vegans \u00b6 Vegans do not consume animal products, which means even a lot of vegetarian options aren't suitable. You can either structure your vegetarian food to be vegan, or get arrange it separr Gluten Free \u00b6 Some people suffer from various conditions that mean they can not consume gluten, which covers protein found in wheat, barley, rye and oats. A lot of places will offer food that is gluten free nowadays, but you have to check with everyone. Lactose Intolerance / Dairy Free \u00b6 Lactose intolerance is not the same thing as a dairy free. Those with dairy allergies can be very serious, so it's best to check with the hacker about how serious it is. Not being able to consume dairy effects a lot of options, most chains will cover it though. Remember, eggs aren't dairy so they can be part of options for this. Religious Requirements \u00b6 Events normally cover religious requirements like Halal/Kosher with vegetarian options, but if you can offer it it would probably be appreciated. Allergies \u00b6 Allergies can be quite hard to handle due to how variable they can be. You'll have to ask attendees when they register and when they arrive so you can accommodate this. Make sure to also be extra careful with uncommon allergies that attendees have One key thing to handle is cross contamination. Allow those with allergies to be served first, so the allergen options don't get cross contaminated from other options. This also ensures there are still available options before the rest of the hackers eat. You can find some information on the NHS website covering common ones . Try to keep an emergency contact for each of your attendees if they have a strange allergy.","title":"Catering"},{"location":"organise/before/catering/#catering","text":"","title":"Catering"},{"location":"organise/before/catering/#distribution","text":"For main meals, you'll need to sort of people with dietary requirements first.

They provide refreshments, meals, prizes, etc. from sponsors. Your budget will come from your sponsors and at times, depending on budget history, any surplus from the previous hackathon's budget. Things to consider: Not everyone is present at every meal. (But sponsors and volunteers need food too.)

Remember to try and tailor the initial email to the company and to think about what that company will want to get out of the hackathon, a local startup will want something very different to Microsoft. A few could starting places when looking for sponsors: Your university/department, most hackathons manage to get their Computer Science department (or equivalent) to put in some money, especially to help with a new hackathon. Local county/city council. (Check for a culture fund!) Large companies Student developer programs. Microsoft offers a good one! Spinoff companies from your university/department.

If you're feeling adventurous, and are confident in your I.T. infrastructure and abilities to maintain it, Rocket.Chat is also an option that has been passed around in the past. Discord \u00b6 Discord is a chat platform originally targeted at gamers. However, has recently seen an uptick in adoption by communities, especially on reddit, but recently also within tech and academic environments. Pros \u00b6 No account creation required (if already on platform) Straightforward Permissions Model No message limit More reliable for pre/post-event communications Easier to indicate mentors/organizers etc. using roles Cons \u00b6 No message threading Limited customizable features e.g. emojis Limitations with platform privacy e.g. mixing anonymous gamer communities with in-person hackathons Slack \u00b6 Slack is chat platform designed for corporate and enterprise use, it's been adopted by thousands both tech and other-sector companies. And has also seen widespread adoption as the platform of choice for tech events. Pros \u00b6 Workspace specific DMs Users can create channels Message Threading Unlimited custom emojis Slackbot Keywords Cons \u00b6 10,000 message limit Requires new account per workspace Limited permissions model 10 Apps/Bots per workspace limit Note : If using slack, make sure to disable public email and phone number listings within the workspace Web Hosting \u00b6 Both Netlify and GitHub Pages are great for static sites. This wiki is hosted on GitHub Pages and compiled with GitHub Actions . For dynamic things, you could use heroku which has a good free tier, it is also part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack . Firebase also works pretty well if you don't want to maintain any infrastructure, but can be limiting as it adopts a serverless model. It's also worth noting, Google's had a history of deprecating features on short notice for the Firebase platform. If you need a fully fledged virtual machine, both Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services offer free tiers for Compute Engine and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) . Ticketing and Applications \u00b6 There are generally two ways to manage sign-ups to your hackathon: tickets and applications. For both options there are plenty of options for platforms, but here are some of the most common. Tickets \u00b6 When picking a ticketing platform, it's important to factor in what you value most (e.g. customizability, ticket management, mailing list support etc.). The two most widely used platforms are Tito and Eventbrite . They're fairly comparable platforms, but they have some differences noted below. Eventbrite \u00b6 Eventbrite has been around for a long time, and operates as both an event discovery system and a ticketing platform. Some of its key advantages are built integrations with services like Mailchimp, the ability to search the platform for events, it also tends to have a better track record when dealing with high volume traffic, which is important if your batches tend to sell out in seconds. Tito \u00b6 Tito hasn't been around as long, and has more of a startup/small operation feeling, but it tends to offer a load of features that organizers value. While tito doesn't natively integrate with mailing list services, it does have a fairly competent mailing list tool (which you have to request access to). But where it really shines is in customizability, a ticket page on tito is dedicated to your event, and you're able to set a custom domain, details data and gdpr policies, use custom styles etc. It's worth noting, though, tito can be a bit awkward for some, such that an order is not a ticket, you need to assign one. Which means abandoned tickets can sometimes cause issues with total availability. Applications \u00b6 There are loads of options for applications, below are some of the most common. If you want a dedicated platform, you'll have to self-host 99% of the time, but there are still plenty of ways to run effective applications without using one. Typeform \u00b6 Typeform isn't a platform for applications, it isn't really anything more than a really pretty and powerful web form maker. Many events have used Typeform for hackathon applications and registrations of the years. They also offer student discount pricing, and have been known to sponsor some hackathons in the past. Quill \u00b6 Quill is also incredibly common, and popular. It's built in JavaScript using express.js and angular.js, originally for HackMIT. Events all over the UK and Europe now use it for their application system as it's simple to setup and use, and fairly easy to customize. HackAssistant Registration \u00b6 HackAssistant has been tried and tested by some of the communities largest events, originally built for HackUPC and HackCU (in Barcelona, and Colorado). Unlike Quill it also provides tools for ranking applications. It's also easily customizable, and can be deployed to Heroku easily. Shortlinks/URL Shorteners \u00b6 Using shortlinks is key to providing links to resources at various points during your event, especially when they're presented to attendees in a form that doesn't give them an immediate hyperlink (e.g. opening ceremony slides, over a PA, etc.). Generally speaking their are two common approaches to providing shortlinks, using a url shortener (e.g. example.com/devpost ) or using subdomains (e.g. devpost.example.com ). Both approaches accomplish the same thing however require different types of configuration, DNS vs. running a web service. URL Shorteners \u00b6 There are loads of options and approaches you can take for URL shortening. Primarily, using a service like bit.ly , or hosting your own. The primary advantage of hosting your own over using a service is the ability to control the domain it runs on. However, as with hosting anything, there's a significantly higher risk of downtime as you're responsible for the infrastructure. Two of the most popular free URL shorteners are bit.ly and tinyurl . bit.ly also lets you customize your links and provides analytics. Additionally, some paid options for URL shorteners that support custom domains are bit.ly , rebrandly , and short.cm . Please note, we do not explicitly endorse any of the listed services. If you wish to host your own URL shortener a couple of options are (smtchahal/url-shortener)[https://github.com/smtchahal/url-shortener] which uses Django and can easily be deployed to Heroku , and Polr which is built in PHP and can easily be deployed using Docker or Kubernetes or to a service like Google Cloud Run . Running your URL shortener on your root domain (e.g. example.com) and then your website on (www.example.com) and setting up requests to the root to redirect to the website by default can add an extra touch of professionalism to your event. As of January 2020, HackNotts runs Polr on hacknotts.com and defaults traffic to www.hacknotts.com which runs on GitHub pages. Subdomains \u00b6 Many domain registrars such as Gandi and Google Domains are able to offer subdomain redirecting for free provided you don't use custom nameservers. It's worth noting, that unlike an HTTP redirect using a URL shortener, subdomain redirects will often have a delay while DNS servers propagate the new record. Additionally, if hackers enter the subdomain incorrectly, they're likely to just get shown a \"server IP address could not be found.\" error in the browser. Info Hub \u00b6 The Manchester CS society wrote a hub they use to track achievements and submissions at StudentHack and GreatUniHack. Signage \u00b6 LibreSignage is a good open source solution, but does need some patches to get it to do what you want. Works with any web browser. info beamer is a powerful option and free if you self host it. Used at large conferences like the CCC. Runs on a Pi or whatever mini computer you have. Trumpet is a signage system written for HackNotts by @MrJamesCo . Navigation \u00b6 If you are running a very large event with a huge venue, it might be worth forking c3nav . Hardware Loaning \u00b6 It isn't uncommon for events to have their own hardware that they're able to lend to hackers. Below are some proposed solutions to keeping track of who has what. If you go with the Google Form/Sheet or Snipe-IT options, it's of relative importance to ensure you have someway of having hackers agree to terms and conditions. Google Form and a Google Sheet \u00b6 The \"low-fi\" solution, but fairly reliable. You can make this solution as complex or simple as you want, but at its core, have a google form for requesting hardware, and then let have your volunteers update and add entires to a spreadsheet when people borrow and return hardware. MLH Hardware Lab \u00b6 Unfortunately, this solution only really applies to events that are partnered with Major League Hacking, but if you are, you can give your hardware to your MLH coach, and they can add your equipment to the MLH Hardware Lab page for the event. Snipe-IT \u00b6 Arguably a bit overkill for a hackathon, it's certainly a valid option if you already use their platform for other community activities. Snipe-IT is a powerful open source asset management system that's used by many companies and organizations of varying sizes. An advantage of Snipe-IT over the others is that it takes care of and gives you access to asset history, and other actions. It also, unlike the MLH Hardware Lab, can allow the person staffing your check-in/check-out to loan equipment to individuals without requiring them to register/request hardware in advance.","title":"Tech"},{"location":"organise/before/tech/#communication","text":"In the immediate run up to, during and after the event, it's important to have a solid platform for communicating with your attendees, sponsors, volunteers, etc. Historically, the two main options have been Discord and Slack .

This changes the format for the event quite a bit, so to run a good online hackathon you need to make quite a few changes. Main thing to keep in mind is that you need to reduce the amount of friction to get involved with your event. Structure \u00b6 You'll want to run your event for longer than just a single weekend. If you do decided to run it over a weekend, make it 36 hours long, starting on the Friday to give people a chance to sleep and catch up. Two potential ways of running these: Run workshops throughout the event. Run your workshops leading up to the event, then have your period of hacking. The first approach is how a lot of events (including Hack Quarantine) do it while the second approach is similar to how a lot of open source conferences handle it. Second approach lets you promote the event with workshops leading up to, and also gives hackers a chance to feel prepared for the hackathon if it's their first time hacking. Have a clear schedule and make sure you communicate to hackers when you have to delay or move something! Workshops \u00b6 Workshops tend to be a more significant part of your event when it is digital as compared to in person events. Speakers \u00b6 Hackathons are a good way of giving people the opportunity to present for the first time! First time speakers do need guidance on how to run a good workshop, so do work with them! Testing \u00b6 It is essential you get your speakers to test beforehand! Preferable a day or more in advance. Presenting \u00b6 Give hackers \"goodie bags\" of code / tools, like jupyter notebooks, so they can quickly get started and experiment. Audience engagement! Be mindful of the medium, people tune into live streams because of the ability to interact with the streamer! Audio quality is really important! People can take a slightly blurly / slow video, but constant clipping in the audio will make people stop watching. Make sure they record it locally, that way if they cut out you still have a copy that can be uploaded to youtube. Streaming \u00b6 Worth noting twitch does not transcode unless you are a partner, so your input stream is sent directly to hackers. Streaming in 1080p 60fps might exclude hackers with weaker internet connections. Misc \u00b6 Be careful with copyrighted content \u00b6 Make sure your speakers are mindful not to include copyrighted content. If there is a need for background music, there are multiple open libraries that just require attribution to use. Community \u00b6 For the community, you need to choose a platform that hackers are familiar with and doesn't require making a whole brand new account to get involved with. If it's not convenient for them, once they close the page they'll never check it again. Ideally, Discord is probably one of the best choices for platforms, as it has very little friction to join in and most hackers already have it. It also has a powerful role system which is useful for moderation. We'd advise against doing everything via things like a zoom / webex call, as it can be quite anxiety inducing to join a call with people you do not know. Not everyone is comfortable showing their face or speaking, so keep it primarily text based with all the voice aspects optional. The one area were voice is useful is doing a progress check-in to get feedback, discuss problems with their project, etc. Little community things like playing a game together really do help engagement! Sponsorship \u00b6 You generally need less sponsorship for these. Main cost is prizes / potentially some server hosting costs. Worth trying to get sponsors that give your hackers something like API credits, as that directly contributes to the value of the hackathon. Submissions \u00b6 Judging \u00b6 You have more time to judge, so use it!","title":"Online Events"},{"location":"organise/online/#structure","text":"You'll want to run your event for longer than just a single weekend.
