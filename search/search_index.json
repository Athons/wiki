It often depended on who the organising team can find who is free on the weekend of the event. How Projects are demoed Depending on the scale of the event: Smaller events have everyone present their projects in front of everyone. Larger events (20+ projects) tend to have a science fair style where people can go around and see everyones projects. The top 5-10 projects at larger events might get to demo them in front of everyone at the end of the event. How Projects are judged Projects are normally rated based on a grading rubric which covers the criteria the organisers are looking for.

What do I need? There are two main things you need: 1 - Git 2 - GitHub Account (This can be substituted for others such as GitLab or BitBucket ) If you're on windows you can either use the Github GUI application or Git command line version. As the command line version is global across Windows, Linux and Mac we will describe that here. Note for Mac Users: Git comes pre-installed, however it maybe installed with a previous version, instead of the current version Lots of Integrated development environments (IDE's) like Atom and VS Code have their own inbuilt GUI systems for Git integration. These are again out of scope here for now. Creating a Repository Repository Name After logging into GitHub you can create a new repository by clicking the + symbol at the top right. You should be presented with a form like screen asking for a repository name, if you already have your hack idea name you can enter it here or if not you could use the hackathon name (aka \"HackSheffield 5\"). These names don't need to be globally unique but must be different to any repository you've made before. Description Enter in a short description of your hack here if you have one, this will be shown at the header of your repository and can be changed at any time so don't worry about not putting one in yet. Public/Private You now have infinite Public and Private repositories, a public repository can be seen by anyone whilst a private repository is just for you. Public repositories still require collaborators or pull requests to be changed by other people. Initialise We will be creating the repository from scratch so no need for any of these settings to be changed. A file named \"README.md\" will be displayed at the front page of your repository and therefore can be used as a manual or title page. A .gitignore file can be used to select certain files in your repository to never commit such as files with passwords in. Licenses can be used to explain to a user what the can and can't do with your code. Click Create Now click create and you have made a repository! Linking your project to GitHub With a repository now on github we can link this to a local folder. Create a local project folder First make a folder either using folder explorer or finder etc... or using the terminal/cmd/console you can use the command cd to change directory (aka cd Desktop ) and then using mkdir (aka mkdir HS5 ) to create the folder. You'll need to then cd into that folder again (aka cd HS5 ). Initialise local folder We now need to tell git that this is where our repository lives. We intitalise this by using the command git init after cd ing to our folder. First commit Add To begin we will make a README.md file in our new git repository, you can do this using notepad or in console using vim/emacs/nano, the fastest method is to echo directly into the file using echo \"# testRepository\" >> README.md . We can then tell git we want to add these changes using git add README.md or if you'd like to add all files in the folder git add . . Commit These additions then need to be boxed into a commit using git commit -m \"First commit\" , here the -m stands for message and \"First commit\"is what these changes will be labeled as in GitHub. Remote Currently our folder doesn't know which repository to send this to and so we have to link the folder to our repository, int GitHub you should find the repository remote at the top labelled \"Quick setup\". Take the link shown there (Best to start with HTTPS) and type git remote add origin followed by the link (aka git remote add origin https://github.com/Hammie217/firstRepository.git ). You should only ever need to run this command at setup of a repository. Push Now git know what we want to commit and where to all we have to do is push or commits to GitHub, we do this using git push origin master . Telling git we want to push our origin to the master branch. Voila You should now be able to see your code in GitHub after you refresh the page! Add collaborators Collaborators can be added in: Settings -> Collaborators. Where you should be able to search for their GitHub accounts. Later commits To add more things to the repository there are three things you need to follow: git add . git commit -m \"Message\" git push origin master Medium Git Merge conflicts Merge conflicts happen when two people try to change the same file lines resulting in conflicting code. To fix these one contributor needs to act to mediate these conflicts to choose which code should stay and what is un-needed. Many IDEs (definitely Atom and VS Code ) have inbuilt systems to help deal with merge conflicts. Status The best thing to do first is to find out where the issues are, the best method of doing this is git status . Most of the time you will see Both modified next to a file name, sometimes a file may have been deleted in another branch. Resolving The easiest method is to use an IDE, start by finding the offending file(s), in Atom and VS Code the sections of code will be highlighted with buttons to select local or remote or both changes to be kept. Use your best intuition to change the code to what is best. Uh Oh In the case you've messed up the merge conflicts and things don't work you can abort the merge at any point to return to the pre-merged state using git merge --abort Pushing After the code is working as desired a normal commit cycle of add, commit and push will send the merged file to GitHub. Branching Creating a branch git checkout -b \"BranchName\" Push git push origin BranchName Merge git checkout master git merge BranchName Pull requests Fork Fork the repository you want to Pull Request using GitHub Fork button at the top right of the repository. Clone the repository to your PC using git clone RepositoryLink where the Repository link is the link found in your forked repository clone button. Branch Create a branch using git checkout -b \"BranchName\" Push changes git add . git commit -m \"Message\" git push origin BranchName Pull Request On the repository you would like to accept your PR you should see a green banner with a button exclaiming change. Follow the pull request section until you enter your code for a review. Your code may be accepted or asked for changes depending on if your code meets the requirements. Simply make the changes and commit again, you may however be required to request a review from your previous reviewer.

Look at how you achieved what you did, and what mistakes were made. It's important to do a debrief just after the hackathon while it's all fresh in your mind. For the positives, write down how you achieved them so you can repeat this for your successor hackathon. For the negatives, work out why they happened and if you can minimise the potential of it happening again. Mistakes are inevitable so don't beat yourself up about it. Documenting what happened will help everyone in the team understand how they can make the hackathon even better in the following year, especially if a new committee takes over. Last thing you want to do is waste time recreating the infrastructure that was created in a previous year, when you could be focusing on new and exciting things for your hackathon.","title":"Debrief"},{"location":"organise/after/photography/","text":"Photography Post photos from your hackathon on your social media.

This is a great way to introduce your event to your attendees, and give them all the information they'll need. This is also an opportunity for sponsors to talk too. Some also have presentations from the hackers. This normally works well inside a lecture theatre that has enough seating for your attendees, sponsors, volunteers, and organisers. You can also use an auditorium for this too. Opening Ceremony A general structure: Welcome to the hackathon Event schedule Things going on at the hackathon. Safety information (fire alarm, etc) Mentors Devpost Sponsors Challenges Presentations Your hackathon may have presentations for all attendees, or just the finalist. Make sure you have some dongles to ensure they can connect up to the display. USB C and Mini Display port are very common (MacBooks and Surface Pros), but it doesn't hurt to have others too! Most lecture theatres have HDMI and VGA already in them, which will cover most situations. Some also have a visualiser that is useful for hardware hacks.

You might need to keep people to only having one portion if you are dealing with certain businesses. This can be done with either a tick mark on their wristbands (Like HackSheffield) or a card (like StudentHack) or even a QR code (like HackUPC). For snacks, having a table and periodically adding new things to it as it gets emptied works. It's worth trying to time this after meals to avoid people getting full before a whole meal. Snack tables should ideally be out of direct sight of the hackers, especially at larger hackathons, to avoid the crab bucket. What To Get It tends to be preferable to get food the hackers can eat with their hands over things like curries. It's generally recommended to have some food at midnight as the time between dinner and Breakfast is quite long. But budget-wise, this can be quite hard to do if you are tight on money. Just some experiences and comments on various places. (We do appreciate comments on smaller businesses as well as other events nearby benefit!) Main Meals Food Trucks You might find nearby food trucks capable of serving your event. Food can be higher quality than the normal franchise and give attendees more of a choice, but does tend to be a bit more expensive. The queues can be quite long, and if they setup outside in the colder months it might be bit too cold for attendees to stand outside for too long. Advised against for larger-sized hackathons. Dominos Everyone love pizza. Can be quite expensive, but depends on the hackathon location and nearest pizza delivery store. Cost quoted to CovHack was \u00a38 per large pizza, where AstonHack was quoted . Need to get a good balance. Over buying Margarita tends to be an issue. The Vegan pizza is not well liked. Papa John's The Vegan pizza, generally, is much better received compared to Dominos. Subway Platters Generally goes down well. They tend to need a lot of time to prepare, so lunch might need run later. Generally done as a Lunch either on the start or the end of the hackaathon. Really good option for vegetarians! And they provide sheets regarding allergies, etc. It's about \u00a318-\u00a320 per plater, with some volume discounts. McDonalds Very good for large orders and very well priced. Tends to go down well with hackers. Decent for vegetarians, if a little boring. They can take the order pretty close to the event (handy if you get funding late) CovHack had a really good experience with our local franchise and AstonHack has had it starting AstonHack 4. Zizzis Offers a good vegan pizza and has a whole menu for dietary requirements Breakfast Heading to an Aldi/Lidl/Costco/Makro and picking up various things is what tends to work best. Breakfast never tends to be too well attended. Many companies that provide breakfast simply do the Costco shop for you and charge you double. Snacks Usual Costco stuff works well. Various soft drinks, juices, crisps, sweets, etc. Try not to buy purely caffenated drinks, if hackers would like to deteriorate their health let them do it, not you. Dietary Requirements Make sure you cater for people with dietary requirements first! This reduces issues related to cross-contamination. It's potentially worth sending an email about what you are serving beforehand to find out issues beforehand. You should keep note of who has requirements that can't be covered by your normal food sources and also maintain a list of places that can cover all the common requirements so attendees do not have to wait for several hours. Hackathons usually do this via their ticket booking system as it is recorded to the attendee. Some common requirements to have are: Vegetarians Pescatarians Vegans Gluten Free Lactose Intolerance / Dairy Free Religious Requirements (eg: Halal) Allergies (eg: Nuts) Some sites that had relatively good information on these: https://ebpcooh.org.uk/common-dietary-requirements-explained/ https://www.comtix.com/blog/7-dietary-restrictions-every-event-planner-aware/ Vegetarians Vegetarians are fairly easy to handle. Most places will offer vegetarian options at the same cost of normal options. Worth considering is that some vegetarians don't consume eggs (some religious requirements cover this) Pescatarians As you generally do not serve fish at hackathons, Pescatarians can be handled the same way as Vegetarians. Vegans Vegans do not consume animal products, which means even a lot of vegetarian options aren't suitable. You can either structure your vegetarian food to be vegan, or get arrange it separr Gluten Free Some people suffer from various conditions that mean they can not consume gluten, which covers protein found in wheat, barley, rye and oats. A lot of places will offer food that is gluten free nowadays, but you have to check with everyone. Lactose Intolerance / Dairy Free Lactose Intolerance is not the same thing as a dairy free. Those with dairy allergies can be very serious, so it's best to check with the hacker about how serious it is. Not being able to consume dairy effects a lot of options. Most chains will cover it though. Remember, eggs aren't dairy so they can be part of options for this. Religious Requirements Events normally cover religious requirements like Halal/Kosher with vegetarian options, but if you can offer it it would probably be appreciated. Allergies Allergies can be quite hard to handle due to how variable they can be. You'll have to ask attendees when they register and when they arrive so you can accommodate this. Make sure to also be extra careful with uncommon allergies that attendees have One key thing to handle is cross contamination. Allow those with allergies to be served first, so the allergen options don't get cross containmened from other options. This also ensures there are still availabile options before the rest of the hackers eat. You can find some information on the NHS website covering common ones Try to keep an emergancy contact for each of your contacts if you have someone with a strange allergy.","title":"Catering"},{"location":"organise/before/catering/#catering","text":"","title":"Catering"},{"location":"organise/before/catering/#distribution","text":"For main meals, you'll need to sort of people with dietary requirements first.

MLH does have a massive documentation with how to organise a hack within a year Hackathon Organising Team Make sure that it is a team of at least 5-6 and more depending on the size and location of the hackathon. Finance If its a recurring hackathon, review the old finance and determine the budget you wish to have. For new hackathons, creating a budget can be hard to start. These would be some stuff you wish to start off with: Food & Snacks Prizes, if your providing your own General amenities (Plates, Cutlery, Cords, etc...) Once done, check with the number of sponsors you wish to have. More info on Sponsorship Tiers Hackathon Size Usually MLH generally allow hackathons within 150-200 attendees and more. Think how much attendees you want to get. Make sure where your hosting the hackathon can appropriately handle that much attendees. Factor in as well the amount of Sponsors coming on site. Sponsorship Tiers This is a core element of the hackathon budget as well as how the hackathon runs. Having different tiers can provide different addons of what a sponsor can do within the hackathon. Most hackathons have at least 3 different tiers which is a common trend between different hackathons. Major League Hacking (MLH) If your creating a brand new Hackathon, MLH may be able to provide some key information and and financial support to ensure that the hackathon runs smoothly.

Prospectus You need to write a sponsorship prospectus. You can find tons of examples in the MLHs repository The DurHack19 Sponsorship Deck can be found here Finding Sponsors Unfortunately the best way to get sponsorship is to 'cold email' as many companies as possible. Remember to try and tailor the initial email to the company and to think about what that company will want to get out of the hackathon, a local startup will want something very different to Microsoft. A few could starting places when looking for sponsors: Your university/department, most hackathons manage to get their Computer Science department (or equivalent) to put in some money, especially to help with a new hackathon. Local county/city council. Spinoff companies from your university/department. Your department's advisory board, this is normally full of companies who want to help students! A good tool to keep track of all the potential sponsors is a CRM, e.g. hubspot, you can add contacts to it as well as set up a sponsorship pipeline. Contracts An example contract with terms removed can be seen here . Many Student Unions have a legal department dedicated to writing, amending, approving and enforcing contracts. It's always nice to have the SU have your back in the unlikely case of a rougue sponsor.

You should always reach out to your university or students' union for advice regarding visas. The gov.uk website also has some useful advice. You might get a request to provide a letter of invitation (LOI) for a hacker who needs a visa. Handling Most events except large ones don't try to handle this as it can be quite lot of hassle and risk. If you do intend to offer this, you need to consider the following: Have an earlier closing date for signups for those who require Visa. This ensures they have plenty of time to apply for the visa and find cheap transport. (2-3 months before was suggested). Verify their student status properly (if you are student hackathon). Confirm everything with your student union! This is much easier to handle if your event is application only. There have been suggestions of asking for proof of transport, etc. There is potentially some risk if they arrive in the country but don't go to your event, which is why some events will only confirm them having a ticket and not issue a full invitation. Example of a supporting document The template used for HackTheMidlands is the following: To whom it may concern, We are pleased to confirm that $NAME is in possession of a ticket for our $EVENT event, which will be hosted on $DATE at the following address, $VENUE_ADDRESS The event will run from $START_TIME until $END_TIME.

Devpost allows you to create table numbers for all the submissions. It's best to have a printer available, with pre made graphics, to print off table numbers. Scrap paper and a marker will also work just fine. Set your tables up so it's easy to navigate between them, so judges and hackers can see everyone's projects. The tables can be set up while the hackers are having lunch in another room. Presentations Presentations are a great way for hackers fo improve their public speaking, as well as have an opportunity to present their ideas in front of an audience. However presentations can take a while, especially with larger hackathons. Devpost can generate a running order, by looking at the list of submissions. Have somebody in charge of this list, who can call down the next team as another is about to present. Someone else can help the current team get their project connected to the projector. Key things to note: Teams won't necessarily have an adapter for their laptop to connect to the projector Presentations might require sound output Phone hacks will require a camera or visualiser Hardware hacks will require a camera or visualiser Some teams will want to display 2 different laptops and switch between them Using a microphone can help project the speakers Having a timer visible to the speakers is helpful for keeping on time. 2-3 minuted is a good benchmark When teams run out of time, organisers should start clapping, which should get the rest of the room clapping Talk to Will for help planning presentations, and how he can come and help you during your event with some additional equipment! Science Fair followed by Finalist Presentations Similar stuff as above, but this time the top 5-10 teams are selected from the science fair to do a presentation in front of the rest of the hackers.

Devpost allows you to create table numbers for all the submissions. It's best to have a printer available, with pre made graphics, to print off table numbers. Scrap paper and a marker will also work just fine. Set your tables up so it's easy to navigate between them, so judges and hackers can see everyone's projects. The tables can be set up while the hackers are having lunch in another room.","title":"Science Fair"},{"location":"organise/during/demos/#presentations","text":"Presentations are a great way for hackers fo improve their public speaking, as well as have an opportunity to present their ideas in front of an audience. However presentations can take a while, especially with larger hackathons. Devpost can generate a running order, by looking at the list of submissions. Have somebody in charge of this list, who can call down the next team as another is about to present. Someone else can help the current team get their project connected to the projector. Key things to note: Teams won't necessarily have an adapter for their laptop to connect to the projector Presentations might require sound output Phone hacks will require a camera or visualiser Hardware hacks will require a camera or visualiser Some teams will want to display 2 different laptops and switch between them Using a microphone can help project the speakers Having a timer visible to the speakers is helpful for keeping on time. 2-3 minuted is a good benchmark When teams run out of time, organisers should start clapping, which should get the rest of the room clapping Talk to Will for help planning presentations, and how he can come and help you during your event with some additional equipment!","title":"Presentations"},{"location":"organise/during/demos/#science-fair-followed-by-finalist-presentations","text":"Similar stuff as above, but this time the top 5-10 teams are selected from the science fair to do a presentation in front of the rest of the hackers.

You should have catering in place for lunch both days, along with dinner and breakfast. It's also best to provide hackers with snacks during the event. Snacks It's best not to place all your snacks out at once. This prevents you running out on the first day, and stops hackers making themselves full before you serve them meals. It's best to store your snacks in an separate room for organisers/volunteers/mentors. Someone can be responsible for placing these out throughout the event. It's likely you will run out of food during the hackathon. Costco is usually very conventient but requires a membership. Amazon Prime Now can be a bit pricey, but takes care of the delivery for you. Getting Ready for Meals To prevent hackers having to queue for hours, it's best to call up small groups to get food at a time. You should always start with dietary requirements, to ensure these hackers are fed before ant cross contamination can happen. To make sure everyone gets fed, it's useful to have meal tickets. These can be distributed at registration, and collected in the meal queue by a volunteer or organiser. Once you're confident that everyone has eaten, you can then let anyone help themselves to left overs.","title":"Food"},{"location":"organise/during/food/#food","text":"Food is a crucial part for any hackathon.

However, it's important to easily connect your hackers to your mentors. Before the hackathon, you should send them an event pack that explains how mentoring is going to work at the hackathon, so they can get signed up to any platform before the hackathon. Before hackers arrive, it's best to brief your mentors on the tools they should use to communicate with the hackers, and how to best approach it. If possible, get your mentors to introduce themselves in your opening ceremony. Lastly, remember to show appreciation to your mentors! Slack / Discord Channel Creating a channel in your hackathons Slack Workspace / Discord Server is the easiest way for hackers to contact mentors. Some hackers, especially new hackers, may feel intimidated to ask for help in a public channel, which defeats the point. Sometimes hackers may private message mentors, but they may only do this if mentors say they can if they don't want to use the channel. Encourage mentors to put a friendly welcome in the channel so hackers know who to talk to when they want help!

Larger Hackathons Once hackathons start getting larger than 200 people, it can get difficult for volunteers to know how they can help without getting in the way. The best approach is to assign them to a specific team. This may be food, logistics, networking, audio/visual, etc. If you ask what skills the volunteers have, you can start sending them information about the team they've been assigned to before the event.
